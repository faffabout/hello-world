# hello-world
my first repository

Hi there!!

faffabout here. I don't really know what I am doing here just willing to learn coding to see how it's like, I supposed.
I used to code in Fortran 90 about 14 years ago and it was kind of ....very exciting :)
I bit stuck with illustrator and after effects for a few months :(... finding myself u know, it requires time n effort. And Engineering is pretty boring, just Autocad. So here I am, another guy trying find my place. A way to help others by technology and engineering, Inspire people trhough graphic design and video editing and contributing to the world desining green spaces and developing green energy. 

Combination of Architecture, Engineering, Renewable energy, Coding, Video editing and Motion Graphics. Maybe too much hahaha, I actually live writing here.

Listening to "if I ever feel better" by Phoenix right now. :) Feel positive.

Anyways, I am digressing. Hello-Github, glad to be part of this community. Live long and prosper. Peace out!!!
