# hello-world
my first repository

Hi there!!

faffabout here. I don't really know what I am doing here just willing to learn coding to see how it's like, I supposed.
I used to code in Fortran 90 about 14 years ago and it was kind of ....very exciting :)
I bit stuck with illustrator and after effects for a few months :(... finding myself u know, it requires time n effort. And Engineering is pretty boring, just Autocad. So here I am, another guy trying to find my place, a way to help others through technology and engineering, inspire people through graphic design and video editing and contributing to the world designing green spaces and developing green energy. 

Maybe all of the above it's just an excuse not to get out of my comfort zone and keep faffing about dreaming.

Combination of Architecture, Engineering, Renewable energy, Coding, Video editing and Motion Graphics. Maybe too much hahaha, I am actually starting to love writing here. 

Listening to "if I ever feel better" by Phoenix right now. :) Feel positive.

Anyways, I am digressing. Hello-Github, glad to be part of this community. Live long and prosper. Peace out!!!
